	Please ensure you have plenty of free space to play around in, outdoors in an open field is a perfect example of where to play.

	The goal of marco is to use the sounds generated from the game to find your way to a specific point. The game uses the amplitude (loudness) of sounds to indicate the direction you should be heading towards. When the sound generated is at its loudest you are heading in the right direction. The consistency of beats indicates the distance to the goal, the more higher the amount of beats the closer you are to the goal and the lower the further away you are.

	The aim of the game is to get the designated point in as fast a time as possible.
